# Advanced Case Workbook Project

## Project Description:
This repository contains a web project demonstrating the application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building a coffee-themed webpage. The project includes:
- **HTML pages** with dynamic content manipulation using JavaScript.
- **JavaScript manipulation** of HTML elements.
- **Interactive calculation functionality** where users can add two numbers.

## Files in This Repository:

1. **coffee-page.html**: Displays a coffee-themed webpage with interactive content.
2. **calculator.html**: A simple calculator where users can input two numbers and see the sum.
3. **dom-manipulation.js**: JavaScript code that manipulates HTML content using the DOM.
4. **coffee-cup-image.jpg**: Image used on the coffee-themed webpage.
5. **coffeeCourses.xml**: XML file containing data about different coffee courses.

## JavaScript Functionality:

1. **calculator.html**: 
   - The `calculator.html` file includes basic HTML structure with two input fields for numbers and a button that triggers a calculation.
   - The **JavaScript function** in `dom-manipulation.js` takes the two numbers, adds them together, and updates the page dynamically to show the result using the `innerHTML` property.

2. **XML Manipulation**:
   - The **XML file (`coffeeCourses.xml`)** stores data about coffee courses. Using **JavaScript**, we can read and manipulate this data, displaying it dynamically in the HTML page.

## How to Use:
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the HTML files (`coffee-page.html` or `calculator.html`) in your browser.
3. Interact with the pages:
   - **Calculator**: Enter two numbers and click "Calculate" to see the result.
   - **Coffee Page**: View the coffee-themed webpage with the image and link to learn more about coffee.
4. Review the **JavaScript manipulation** code and how it interacts with the DOM to display content dynamically.

## Technologies Used:
- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the page.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic content manipulation and calculations.
- **DOM**: JavaScript DOM methods to interact with HTML content.
- **XML**: Used to store course data which is then manipulated by JavaScript.
